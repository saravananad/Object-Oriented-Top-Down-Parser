# Object-Oriented-Top-Down-Parser

###About
This project parses the code using the top down approach and tries to replicate the code generation of Java ByteCode.
###Installation
The main method is defined in the parser class. 
Invoke the Main method in the Parser class. The program to be the parsed has to be entered in the console of the running program.
###Note
This code could be quite similar to the byte code generated by Java, but it would not be the same. The languages' code generation logic has some optimizations which are out of scope in this project.
